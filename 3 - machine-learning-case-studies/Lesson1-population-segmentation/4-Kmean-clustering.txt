K-Means Clustering
++++++++++++++++++

To perform population segmentation, 

1 - k-means clustering to group data into similar clusters. 
2 - k-means clustering algorithm can be broken down into a few steps assuming that you have n-dimensional data
	2.1 - You select k, a predetermined number of clusters that you want to form. Then k points (centroids for k clusters) are selected at random locations in feature space. 
	      and then For each point in your training dataset:
		A - You find the centroid that the point is closest to 
		B - And assign that point to that cluster
		C - for each cluster centroid, you move that point such that it is in the center of all the points that are were assigned to that cluster in step B.
		D - Repeat steps B and C until youâ€™ve either reached convergence and points no longer change cluster membership _or_ until some specified number of iterations have been reached.
