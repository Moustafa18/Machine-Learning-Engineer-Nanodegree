1 - each input has a label
2 - create a model by training it (classification)
3 - purpose: get higher accuracy on testing model with different data

unsupervised
++++++++++++
1 - each input does not have a label
2 - create a model (clustering)
3 - accuracy is not our metric such that we get the distance or the similarity between the test input and model cluster
4 - used in simple project like specify car not car model but you can use specific classification model
