Case Studies
++++++++++++
 
1 - Population Segmentation using SageMaker:

	1.1 - Looking at a portion of US census data (https://www.census.gov/data.html)
	1.2 - Using a combination of unsupervised learning methods to extract meaningful components from that data 
	      and group regions by similar census-recorded characteristics. 
	1.3 - This case study will be a deep dive into Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering methods
	1.4 - the end result will be groupings that are used to inform things like localized marketing campaigns and voter campaign strategies.

2 - Detecting Credit Card Fraud

	2.1 - This case will demonstrate how to use supervised learning techniques, specifically SageMakerâ€™s LinearLearner, 
	2.2 - for fraud detection. The payment transaction dataset we'll work with is unbalanced with many more examples of valid transactions vs. fraudulent
 		2.2.1 - solution: you will investigate methods for compensating for this imbalance  and tuning your model to improve its performance according to a specific product goal.

3 - Time-Series Forecasting:

	3.1 - This case demonstrates how to train SageMaker's DeepAR model for forecasting predictions over time. 
	3.2 - Time-series forecasting is an active area of research because a good forecasting algorithm often takes in a number of different features 
	      and accounts for seasonal or repetitive patterns. 
	3.3 - In this study, you will learn a bit about creating features out of time series data and formatting it for training.

Project: Plagiarism Detection
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1 - building and deploying a plagiarism classification model. 
2 - This project will test your ability to do [text] data processing and feature extraction, 
    your ability to train and evaluate models according to an accuracy specification, and your ability to deploy a trained model to an endpoint.

Custom Models - Non-Linear Classification
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1 - Adding on to what you have learned in the credit card fraud case study, 
2 - you will learn how to manage cases where classes of data are not separable by a linear line. 
3 - You'll train and deploy a custom, PyTorch neural network for classifying data.
