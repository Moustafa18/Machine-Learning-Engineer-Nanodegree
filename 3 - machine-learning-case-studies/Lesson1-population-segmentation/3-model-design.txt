1 - unsupervised data ---> human --> human generated labels
2 - unsupervised data ---> model --> model generated labels
3 - active learning model learns from human generated labels

it creates the two approches discussed before into one feature called ground truth

Ground truth
++++++++++++
1 - send sample of data to be labelled by human
2 - create an unsupervised model
3 - use the combination of human generated labels and active learning model to efficiently label the data
4 - it reduces the time and the cost of labelling datasets by about 70%
