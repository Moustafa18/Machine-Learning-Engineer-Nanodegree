Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1 - it attempts to reduce the number of features within a dataset while retaining the “principal components”, 
    which are defined as weighted combinations of existing features that:
	1.1 - Are uncorrelated with one another, so you can treat them as independent features, and
	1.2 - Account for the largest possible variability in the data!

2 - So, depending on how many components we want to produce, the first one will be responsible for the largest variability 
on our data and the second component for the second-most variability, and so on. Which is exactly 
what we want to have for clustering purposes!


3 - PCA is commonly used when you have data with many many features.

4 - PCA make a linear comcination of the existing feature to increase the variation on data

The idea is that components that cause a larger variance will help us to better differentiate 
between data points and (therefore) better separate data into clusters.

the result will be the eigen vector which has the largest variance of the data

1- apply pca model on more feature and then select the top
2- specify vaiance = sigma(s(1,n)^2)/sigma(s(1,:)^2)
