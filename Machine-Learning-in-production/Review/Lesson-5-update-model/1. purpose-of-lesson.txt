purpose
+++++++

Take a look at updating an existing endpoint so that it conforms to a different endpoint configuration.

+++++++
Reasons
+++++++
1 - Performing an A/B test and updating a model which is no longer performing as well.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Steps to compare two different model
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1 - Performing an A/B test between two different models.
2 - once we've decided on a model to use, updating the existing endpoint so that it only sends data to a single model.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Steps to improve your model with new data
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1 - we've built a model and begun using it, 
2 - the assumptions on which our model is built begin to change.
3 - we need to modify our model, often this means re-training it.
4 - we'd like to update the existing endpoint without having to shut it down. 
5 - Fortunately, SageMaker allows us to do this in a straightforward way.

++++++++
Example
++++++++
in the sentiment analysis examples that we've looked at our models are based on a vocabulary consisting 
of the 5000 most frequently appearing words in the training set. But what happens if, over time, the usage of words changes? Then our model may not be as accurate.
