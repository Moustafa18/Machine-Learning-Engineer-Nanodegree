1 - low level approach to creating endpoint configurations allows us to create endpoints that are more sophisticated. 
	1.1 - endpoints which receive data and route that data to one of many different models.
	1.2 - here we are only using two different models (XGBoost and linear model) but there may be situations in which you would want more.

2 - SageMaker provides functionality to update an existing endpoint so that it conforms to a different endpoint configuration. 
    Further, SageMaker does this in a way that does not require the existing endpoint to be shut down.

This is very beneficial as you may be working in an environment where there are other services that depend on your deployed endpoint.

switch from XGBoost model to new linear model
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1 - check that linear model (new) perform an accurcy closely to XGBoost model (old) by using A/B test
2 - after make the first step, use update_endpoint to update end point to linear 
3 - what happen if th linear end point config is not ready
	3.1 - sagemaker wants that is no go down on the service
	3.2 - sagemaker on the background create an endpoint with the new conf of linear model
	      and when it is ready, it will route the whole data to the created model.

A/B test

1 - create an end point that receives a bunch of data and it take a decision which model will send data to it
2 - the amount of data that end point will sent to is dependant on the initial varient weight

so that if the initial varient weight of XGBoost model = 2 and the initial varient weight of Linear model = 1
then 1 / 3 of data sent to Linear model and 2 / 3 of data sent to XGBoost model
