1 -  improve our models using one of SageMaker's features.
2 - Generally the approach to finding the best parameters is to train a bunch of models with different parameters and 
then choose the model that works best.
3 - SageMaker provides an automated way of doing this.

using sagemaker to do that
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1 - SageMaker provides an automated way of doing this
2 - SageMaker also does this in an intelligent way using Bayesian optimization
3 - you specify ranges for our hyperparameters.
4 - SageMaker will explore different choices within those ranges, increasing the performance of our model over time.

1 - CloudWatch provides a user interface through which we can examine various logs generated during training.
2 - This can be especially useful when diagnosing errors.
