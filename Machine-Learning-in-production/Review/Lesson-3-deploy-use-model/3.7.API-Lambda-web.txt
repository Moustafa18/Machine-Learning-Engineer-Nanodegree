two obstacles we are going to need to overcome. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1 - Security issue  
2 - Data processing 

solution:

--> use of Amazon Lambda and API Gateway

Steps of view thw sentiment of user's movie review
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1 - A user will type out a review and enter it into our web app.
2 - Web app will send that review to an endpoint that we created using API Gateway. 
3 - This endpoint will be constructed so that anyone (including our web app) can use it.
4 - API Gateway will forward the data on to the Lambda function
5 - Once the Lambda function receives the user's review, it will process that review by tokenizing it and then creating a bag of words encoding of the result. 
6 - Lambda function will send the processed review off to our deployed model.
7 - When the deployed model performs inference on the processed review, the resulting sentiment will be returned back to the Lambda function.
8 - Lambda function will then return the sentiment result back to our web app using the endpoint that was constructed using API Gateway.
