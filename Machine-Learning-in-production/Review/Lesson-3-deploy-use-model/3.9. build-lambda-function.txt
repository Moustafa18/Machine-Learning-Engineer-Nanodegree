Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function

Since we want the Lambda function to call a SageMaker endpoint, 
we need to make sure that it has permission to do so. To do this, 
we will construct a role that we can later give the Lambda function.

1 - go to IAM
2 - create role
3 - choose lambda
4 - Amazonsagemakerfullaccess permission
5 - give it a name like LambdaSagermakerRole 


Part B: Create a Lambda function

Now it is time to actually create the Lambda function. 
Remember from earlier that in order to process the user provided input and send it to our endpoint 
we need to gather two pieces of information:

1 - The name of the endpoint, and
2 - the vocabulary object.
We will copy these pieces of information to our Lambda function, after we create it.

a - aws lambda
b - create a function
c - name the lambda function
d - select python 3.6
