Boston Housing Data

1 - For our very first time using SageMaker we will be looking at the problem of estimating the median cost of 
a house in the Boston area using the Boston Housing Dataset.

2 - We will be using this dataset often throughout this module as it provides a great example on which to try out all of 
SageMaker's features.

3 - In addition, we will be using a random tree model. 
In particular, we will be using the XGBoost algorithm. 
The details of XGBoost are beyond the scope of this module as we are interested in learning about SageMaker. 
If you would like to learn more about XGBoost I would recommend starting with the documentation 
which you can find at https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The notebook we will be working though in this video and in the following two videos can be found in the Tutorial directory
and is called Boston Housing - XGBoost (Batch Transform) - High Level.ipynb. 
Now that you know why Boston Housing and XGBoost are in the name, let's talk a bit about the rest of it.

First, Batch Transform is the method we will be using to test our model once we have trained it. 
This is something that we will discuss a little more later on.

Second, High Level describes the API we will be using to get SageMaker to perform various machine learning tasks. 
In particular, it refers to the Python SDK whose documentation can be found here: 
https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. 
This high level approach simplifies a lot of the details when working with SageMaker and can be very useful.
