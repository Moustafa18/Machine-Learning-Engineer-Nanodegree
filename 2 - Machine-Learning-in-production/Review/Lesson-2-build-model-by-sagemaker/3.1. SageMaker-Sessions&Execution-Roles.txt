SageMaker has some unique objects and terminology that will become more familiar over time. 
There are a few objects that you'll see come up, over and over again:

1 - Session - is a special object that allows you to do things like manage data in S3 and create and train any machine learning models; 
you can read more about the functions that can be called on a session, at this documentation (https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/session.html). 
The upload_data function should be close to the top of the list! 
You'll also see functions like train, tune, and create_model all of which we'll go over in more detail, later.

2 - Role - Sometimes called the execution role, this is the IAM role that you created when you created your notebook instance. 
The role basically defines how data that your notebook uses/creates will be stored. 
You can even try printing out the role with print(role) to see the details of this creation.
