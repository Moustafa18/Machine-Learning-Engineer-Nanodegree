1 - we will create an XGBoost model similar to the ones that we have constructed in the past in order to predict the median housing cost in Boston.
2 - The difference this time is that we are using a hybrid approach, including both the high level and low level functionality:
	2.1 - the high level approach to train a model (to produce model artifacts) 
	2.2 - the low level approach to construct the model itself and to construct the endpoint configuration. 
	      The reason for this is so that we can have more control over how our endpoint behaves.

we need to create another model with new machine learning technique

1 - using linear model will improve the accuracy
2 - return result in json formate not csv format as on XGBoost

Depending on the application you have in mind for a particular machine learning model, 

1 - accuracy may not always be the metric you wish to optimize. 
2 - There may be some other constraints on getting the model to work in production. 
	2.1 -  your model may not be very easy to interpret or maybe performing inference for a particular model may be too costly.
3 - At all you want to try alternative models. 

In the example we are working on here we construct a linear learner model as an alternative to the previously created XGBoost model.
