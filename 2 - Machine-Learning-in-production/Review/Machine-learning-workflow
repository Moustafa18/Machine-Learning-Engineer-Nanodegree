workflow

1 - explore and process data
	1.1 - Retrive: download from train and test files
	1.2 - clean and explore: explore and visualizing the data and try to clean it from outliers
	1.3 - prepare/transform: tranform data and prepare it for training and normalizing and convert formate of data and split
							 into training, validating: model tunning and selection and testing data
2 - modeling
	2.1 - Develop and train modele
	2.2 - validate/evalute modele: tune the model with validation data set
3 - deployment:
	3.1 - deploy to production
	3.2 - monitor and update model and data
