hyperparameter tuning inside of SageMaker
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1 - we start with a base collection of hyperparameters which describe a default model. 
2 - We then give some additional set of hyperparameters ranges. 
3 - These ranges tell SageMaker which hyperparameters can be varied, with the goal being to improve the default model.

1 - specifying a metric. 
2 - describe how many total models we want SageMaker to train.

+++++
steps
+++++
1 - set a default hyperparameter
2 - add the hyperparameters discussed on notebook
3 - fit the default hyperparameter with training data and the ranges disccuused on 2 with validation data
4 - get the best training model
5 - use attach method to get the best training model
5 - use the transformer to test the model

Note:
+++++
1 - when creating a tuned model in this notebook, we also saw how the attach method can be used to create an Estimator object 
    which is attached to an already completed training job. This method is useful in other situations as well.

2 - You will notice that throughout this module we train the same model multiple times. 

In most of the Boston Housing notebooks

1 - we train an XGBoost model with the same hyperparameters.
2 - why ? The reason for this is so that each notebook is self contained and can be run even if you haven't run the other notebooks.

In your case however, you've probably already created an XGBoost model on the Boston Housing training set with the standard hyperparameters. 
If you wanted to, you could use the attach method to avoid having to re-train the model.
