hyperparameter tuning job using the low level
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
it requires two different things:

1 - Training job that will be used as the base job for the hyperparameter tuning task. 
such that it is almost exactly the same as the standard training job description 
except that instead of specifying HyperParameters we specify StaticHyperParameters. 
That is, the hyperparameters that we do not want to change in the various iterations and objective like regression(linare) or logisitic.

2 - Tuning job includes the different ranges of hyperparameters that we do want SageMaker to vary, 
    in addition to the total number of jobs we want to have created and how to determine which model is best.
